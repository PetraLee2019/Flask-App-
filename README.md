# Full-Stack-Flask-App-Python-Flask-microservice
## Background
### Create a fullstack flash application with requirements below, 
Backend: Python Flask microservice that has two API methods: “get” and “set”.  The method “get” takes a “key” argument and returns the current value associated with the key, if it exists. The method “set” takes two arguments, a “key” and a “value”, and sets the value of “key” to the specified value.  The data should be persisted to a database using sqlalchemy.

Frontend: design and code a front end for the above key/value API service.  Users should be able to load an HTML page and get/set keys.  Use HTML, CSS, and Javascript/JQuery as necessary.

Advanced: add a user model to the above service.  A user should be able to sign up, log in, and log out. While logged in, they should only be able to interact with and modify keys they have created - do not allow users to see or modify another users key/value pairs.  Logged out users should not be able to do anything other than log in.”
